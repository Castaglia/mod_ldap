If you are using a version of mod_ldap included with a ProFTPD release,
you can simply:

tar xvzf proftpd-version.tar.gz
cd proftpd-version
./configure --with-modules=mod_ldap
make
make install
Add the contents of posixAccount-objectclass to your slapd.oc.conf (or
    equivalent) and restart your LDAP server. If you plan on using mod_ldap
    for group lookups, also add the contents of posixGroup-objectclass.
The 'ldif' file contains a sample ldif. Modify it to your liking and say
    ldapadd -D your-root-dn -w your-root-dn-password < ldif

If you wish to use a newer version of mod_ldap that is not yet included with
a release version of ProFTPD, simply download the file mod_ldap.c, say:

cp -f mod_ldap.c proftpd-version/contrib

and then follow the same steps as above.
