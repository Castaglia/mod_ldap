v2.8.18:
* Remove all local caching code in favor of the recently added caching in
  the ProFTPD Auth layer.
* Silence some compiler warnings.
* To verify non-crypt() password hashes locally with OpenSSL, it is no
  longer necessary to edit mod_ldap.c to enable HAVE_OPENSSL. Instead,
  build ProFTPD with the --enable-openssl argument to configure.

v2.8.17:
* Use non-deprecated LDAP API functions if the LDAP SDK is new enough to
  comply with draft-ietf-ldapext-ldap-c-api-04.

v2.8.16:
* Add 'LDAPAliasDereference never|search|find|always' directive, which
  defaults to never. This default is compatible with previous versions,
  which did not support alias dereferencing.
* Fix LDAPAttr support when more than one LDAPAttr directive is used.
* Sync with ProFTPD API: set session.auth_mech to indicate that we've
  successfully authenticated the user.
* Eliminate segfaults when group information for an LDAP user is available
  from other sources (such as mod_auth_unix). Thanks to Erick Briere
  <Erick.Briere@afp.com>.
* Make sure to count %u escapes as well as %v escapes when determining
  filter length.
* Fix parenthesizing in connection code.

v2.8.15:
* Erroneous release; contained 2.8.14 by mistake.

v2.8.14:
* Fix authentication when LDAPAuthBinds is enabled, which broke in 2.8.13.
* Fix a typo in the group-by-name filter.

v2.8.13:
* This release REQUIRES ProFTPD 1.2.11rc1 or later.
* mod_ldap now uses ProFTPD's CreateHome to create home directories. Some
  LDAPHomedirOnDemand directives have been removed in favor of CreateHome.
  The directives that apply to home directory path name generation still
  exist, but have been renamed to LDAPGenerateHomedir.
* The LDAP protocol version now defaults to LDAPv3. If you need to use
  LDAPv2, say 'LDAPProtocolVersion 2' in your proftpd.conf. (Bug #2443)
* LDAP attribute names are now configurable via proftpd.conf. For example,
  if you want to change the uid attribute name, say 'LDAPAttr uid myUidAttr'
  in your proftpd.conf.
* The define to enable TLS support has been renamed to USE_LDAP_TLS.
* The '%u' escape is now supported in all cases where '%v' is.
* ProFTPD's UserPassword directive now works with LDAPAuthBinds enabled.
  (Bug #2482)
* Changed ldap_quota_lookup CMD to a HOOK.
* Fixed a few compiler type warnings.

v2.8.12:
* Group code memory manipulation fixes (Phil Oester (phil at theoesters dot
  com))
* Default quota support
* LDAP connections created for authenticated binds now honor the LDAPUseTLS
  directive.

v2.8.11:
* mod_quotatab limit support
* Allow ATTR_* compiler defines to be overridden on the build command line,
  e.g.: CFLAGS="-DUID_ATTR=foo" ./configure
* The canonical username from the LDAP directory is now used in directory
  creation.
* LDAPForceHomedirOnDemand to force the use of the generated home directory
  instead of the directory provided by the LDAP directory.
* Support for permissions on LDAPHomedirOnDemand suffixes. You can say:

  LDAPHomedirOnDemandSuffix foo:755 bar:700

  in your proftpd.conf.
* Support for %v escapes in LDAPDoAuth directive to allow fetching the
  user's entry directly, without performing a search first. For example,

  LDAPDoAuth on uid=%v,dc=example,dc=com

  will fetch the entry uid=[username],dc=example,dc=com directly when a user
  logs in, saving some effort on the part of the LDAP directory.
* Leading directories are now checked for and creation is no longer
  attempted if they already exist.
* Miscellaneous pedanticism & cleanup in error messages and the code itself.

v2.8.10:
* Ditch ldap_build_filter() (non-portable and/or deprecated) in favor of
  our own translation function. This should make mod_ldap build against
  OpenLDAP 2.1.x and Novell eDirectory, among others.

v2.8.9:
* Added explicit OpenSSL link exception to the license.

v2.8.8:
* ProFTPD Bug 1659 - LDAP config handlers should use c->pool instead of
  permanent_pool

v2.8.7:
* Properly drop root privs in the LDAPHomedirOnDemand code if we're
  returning prematurely due to an error condition.
* Small cleanup of the LDAPHomedirOnDemand directory creation code.

v2.8.6:
* Fix to the user-caching code that now prevents the cache from
  returning an empty password struct in certain situations.

v2.8.5:
* Small fix in the group handlers - group lookups would sometimes be
  attempted even if they were disabled.

v2.8.4:
* Fix for segfaults when optional arguments are omitted from
  LDAPDoGIDLookups directive

v2.8.3:
* Secondary group support (thanks to Andreas Strodl for providing patches)
* LDAPHomedirOnDemand modes are now absolute; they are no longer subject
  to ProFTPD's umask.
* LDAPDefault[UG]ID directives should now support the full range of
  32-bit UIDs.
* Sanity checking is now done on LDAPDefault[UG]ID arguments to ensure
  they're numeric.
* LDAPDoGIDLookups now takes an extra argument. Its arguments are now:

  LDAPDoGIDLookups on|off group-base-dn by-name-filter by-uid-filter

  by-name-filter defaults to (&(cn=%v)(objectclass=posixGroup)) and
  by-uid-filter defaults to (&(gidNumber=%v)(objectclass=posixGroup)).

v2.8.2:
* Fixed a privilege escalation bug. If LDAPHomedirOnDemand is enabled and
  creation of the user's home directory fails, the server does not
  relinquish root privileges. There shouldn't be exploitable, but all
  users with LDAPHomedirOnDemand enabled are encouraged to upgrade.

v2.8.1:
* Fixed a bug that prevented proper permissions being applied to home
  directories created on demand.
* Fixed an issue that would prevent per-VirtualHost configuration directives
  from being properly recognized.

v2.8:
* The username escape sequence in search filter templates has changed.
  You must now use %v instead of %u as the escape for the username. For
  example, if you had:

    LDAPDoAuth on dc=example,dc=com (uid=%u)

  in your proftpd.conf with a previous version of mod_ldap, you will need
  to change this to:

    LDAPDoAuth on dc=example,dc=com (uid=%v)

* LDAPAuthBinds is now enabled by default. I'm sick of hearing "Your
  mod_ldap is broken; it won't talk to my LDAP server and I've ignored the
  convenient error message about userPassword that mod_ldap logs."

* The full path to user home directories is now created. Directories leading
  up to the user's home directory are created root-owned and mode 755 (i.e.,
  they are not subject to the mode argument to LDAPHomedirOnDemand). Home
  directory creation now works for all users, not just users with the same
  UID/GID as the main ProFTPD server. Lastly, the mode argument to
  LDAPHomedirOnDemand is no longer subject to ProFTPD's Umask.

* TLS support (You'll need to edit mod_ldap.c to define USE_LDAPV3_TLS and
  recompile proftpd, then say 'LDAPUseTLS on' in your proftpd.conf). This
  may or may not work with non-OpenLDAP SDKs; I'd love to hear if anyone has
  it working with the Mozilla LDAP SDK or any others.

* The LDAP search sizelimit is now set to prevent LDAP server thrashing with
  wildcarded usernames.

* Basic caching support has been added. This should cut down on the number
  of queries made to the directory server. In addition, negative caching
  is now enabled by default.

* LDAPHomedirOnDemandSuffix can now take multiple arguments (multiple
  directories to create) and can be activated independently of
  LDAPHomedirOnDemand.

* With the addition of LDAPHomedirOnDemandPrefix, home directories can now
  be completely autogenerated, removing the need for a homeDirectory
  attribute in each user's LDAP entry. Say:

    LDAPHomedirOnDemandPrefix /home

  in your proftpd.conf to give users a home directory with the format
  /home/username. In this example, the user joe would be given the home
  directory /home/joe.

* Attribute names are now #defines at the top of mod_ldap.c. You can now
  change attribute names by editing mod_ldap.c and recompiling.

* The LDAPDefaultUID and LDAPDefaultGID directives can now be forced;
  enabling LDAPForceDefaultUID or LDAPForceDefaultGID will apply the
  default UID or GID (respectively) even if a user has a different UID/GID
  in his uidNumber or gidNumber attribute.

* Fairly extensive code cleanup and comment syncing.

v2.7.6:
* Fixing the OpenLDAP 2 fixes.

v2.7.5:
* Fixes for OpenLDAP 2 support.
* Fix LDAP authentication filter use; previously, the user-specified search
  filter would not be used in the second stage of authenticating a user.

v2.7.4:
* The LDAPDefaultAuthScheme directive should function properly now.

v2.7.3:
* Removed some old, useless code.

v2.7.2:
* LDAPQueryTimeout fix. In mod_ldap v2.7.1, in some situations, the query
  timeout could be set to -1, which would cause all LDAP lookups to fail.

v2.7.1:
* Ported MacGyver's portable UID/GID code to mod_ldap
* The value passed to LDAPQueryTimeout is now honored (the timeout isn't
  simply set to 1 second)

v2.7:
* Added a fix for picky LDAP servers like Sun Directory Services; using
  AuthBinds with those LDAP servers would break in previous mod_ldap
  versions.  See the comments in the code for more details (search for "Sun
  Directory Services").
* You can now pass a file mode to LDAPHomedirOnDemand to create home
  directories with that mode.
* Improved group support; mod_ldap now supports multiple memberUid
  attributes for a group object.
* Miscellaneous neatening/tightening of high-level auth/lookup handler
  functions.
* You can now specify custom LDAP search filters at runtime. See the
  configuration guide (doc/Configuration.html) entries for LDAPDo* for more
  details.
* Objectclass is now enforced. You *must* have an objectclass attribute for
  each of your LDAP objects. This attribute must have a value of
  'posixAccount' ("objectclass: posixAccount"). For groups, this attribute
  must have the value 'posixGroup' ("objectclass: posixGroup"). If you wish
  to disable this objectclass enforcement, use the the LDAP filter
  "(uid=%u)" for Auth and UID lookups (see doc/Configuration.html for how to
  specify a custom LDAP search filter).
* Removed allowedServices code. The functionality that allowedServices
  provided can now be duplicated with a modified LDAP search filter.

  For example, to replicate basic allowedServices checking, pass this LDAP
  search filter to LDAPDoAuth:
  (&(uid=%u)(|(allowedServices=*FTP*)(!(allowedService=*))))

  To emulate deniedServices checking, use this search filter:
  (&(uid=%u)(!(deniedServices=*FTP*)))

  To emulate *both* allowedServices and deniedServices checking, use this
  filter (beware line wrap):
  (&(uid=%u)(|(allowedServices=*FTP*)(!(allowedService=*)))(!(deniedServices=*FTP*)))

v2.6.1:
* Fixed a bug that would prevent proper search scope selection.

v2.6:
* HomedirOnDemandSuffix - create an additional subdirectory in a user's home
  directory (/home/user/anotherdirectory) on demand
* Minor group fixes/cleanups - supplementary groups now work properly
* Password {scheme}s are now treated in a case-insensitive manner.
* Password-hash support for any crypto method OpenSSL supports
  To enable extended OpenSSL password hash support, edit mod_ldap.c and
  uncomment #define HAVE_OPENSSL. You'll also need to edit Make.rules to
  link against OpenSSL. Further details are provided in mod_ldap.c.
* Runtime search scope selection; one-level or subtree searches can be
  selected from proftpd.conf.

v2.5.2:
* Fixed a bug that would allow unauthorized users to log in when mod_ldap
  is used with other authentication modules and LDAPAuthBinds is set to on.

v2.5.1:
* Fixed a one-line bug that broke password authentication when AuthBinds
  weren't being used.

v2.5:
* Authenticated bind support added. mod_ldap now fetches all user information
  except for userPassword as the DN specified in LDAPDNInfo and then re-binds
  to the LDAP server as the connecting user with the user-supplied password.
  If the bind succeeds, the user is allowed to log in. This also has the
  added advantage of allowing mod_ldap to support any password encryption
  scheme that your LDAP server supports. Also, a privileged DN is no longer
  needed to read the userPassword attribute from the LDAP server.
* Realized I wasn't checking the return value of find_config() for NULL
  values, this would cause ProFTPD to segfault if certain config file
  entries were not present.
* Removed debugging code that might contain NULL values; passing a NULL
  value to printf() and friends under Solaris causes a segfault.
* Miscellaneous cleanups, code neatening.

v2.0:
* Config file syntax revamped:
   LDAPServer            localhost
   LDAPDNInfo            cn=your-dn,dc=horde,dc=net dnpass
   LDAPQueryTimeout      5
   LDAPDoAuth            on "dc=users,dc=horde,dc=net"
   LDAPDoUIDLookups      on "dc=users,dc=horde,dc=net"
   LDAPDoGIDLookups      on "dc=groups,dc=horde,dc=net"
   LDAPDefaultUID        35000
   LDAPDefaultGID        1000
   LDAPNegativeCache     on
   LDAPHomedirOnDemand   on
   LDAPDefaultAuthScheme clear
* Configurable LDAP query timeout [Peter Deacon <peterd@iea-software.com>]
* Cleartext password "encryption" scheme ("{clear}mypass")
* UID-to-name and GID-to-name lookups in directory listings
* Separate prefixes for user and group lookups
* Can turn on/off UID-to-name and GID-to-name lookups independently
* Default [UG]IDs. Say you want to have a web-toaster type of deal, with
  all users having the same [UG]IDs. Just don't put [ug]idNumber attrs in
  your LDAP database for those users, and set these configuration
  directives. Any user that doesn't have a [UG]ID in the LDAP database will
  have that info filled in with the default [UG]ID.
* mod_ldap is now able to function in a pure virtual-user environment;
  please note, however, that the loginShell LDAP attr still must be a
  valid shell. You can turn this check off by saying RequireValidShell off
  in your proftpd.conf
* allowedServices attr: (I broke with objectclass here, couldn't find
  something that seemed to fit this.) This attribute contains a
  comma-deliminated list of services to allow this particular user.  The
  string "FTP" corresponds to FTP service. If no allowedServices attr is
  present, all services will be allowed.
* You can have alternate LDAP servers; just specify LDAPServer "host1
  host2"; [Peter Deacon <peterd@iea-software.com>]
* LDAPHomedirOnDemand to automatically create home directories in a
  virtual-user environment. [patch: Bert Vermeulen <bert@be.easynet.net>]
* LDAPDefaultAuthScheme to select the authentication scheme to use when
  no {prefix} is present in a user's userPassword LDAP attr.
  [patch: Bert Vermeulen <bert@be.easynet.net>]
* Virtual hosting support may or may not work okay; theoretically, I think
  adding LDAP configuration directives to a <VirtualHost> block will work,
  but this hasn't been tested.

New Tested Platforms:

* Solaris 2.6 with Netscape Directory Server and the Mozilla LDAP C SDK,
  available at http://www.mozilla.org/directory/csdk.html.
  Peter Fabian <fabian@staff.matavnet.hu>
* Solaris 7 with gcc 2.95.1 and OpenLDAP 1.2.7
  Ralf Kruedewagen <Ralf.Kruedewagen@meocom.de>

v1.2:
* made the variables for the config entries static
* moved the meat of the ldap querying code to a separate function, this
  gets the individual getpw*() handlers down to about 15-20 lines each.
  also paves the way for easy LDAP group lookups too.
* explicitly set ld = NULL in p_endpwent(), looks like ldap_unbind()
  doesn't always set it to NULL, and bad things happen later.
* fixed a showstopper: if there's a user/group directive in proftpd.conf,
  mod_ldap:getpwnam() will be called to look up the user. since the
  LDAP config variables aren't initialized yet, the LDAP libraries crash
  and burn upon encountering a NULL ldap_prefix. put some checks in
  p_setpwent() to check for this and disable LDAP lookups before the
  parent forks and the config is initialized. thanks to Sean Murphy
  <smurphy@berbee.com> for sending me on this path.
* modified pw_auth() so that it will assume crypt() if there's no leading
  {scheme} in the password returned by the LDAP query.
* pw_auth() turned off logging of unidentifiable password encryption
  schemes; this would syslog the encrypted password returned by the ldap
  server. many people have their logs tightened, but not all.
* a few miscellaneous changes & cleanups

v1.1:
* Added $Libraries$ directive to mod_ldap so the module is now entirely
  self-contained.
* Changed one reference to sprintf() to snprintf() and changed uidstr
  in p_getpwuid() to have a length of BUFSIZ.
* Added config option (LDAPNegativeCache) to turn LDAP negative caching
  on and off. The default is off (don't do LDAP negative caching).
* Added entries to doc/Configuration.html for all the LDAP configuration
  directives.
* MacGyver added mod_ldap to the ProFTPD CVS tree; proftpd-ldap-1.1
  is now in sync with ProFTPD CVS.

v1.0:
* Initial release of proftpd-ldap
