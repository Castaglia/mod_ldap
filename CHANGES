v1.1:
    * Added $Libraries$ directive to mod_ldap so the module is now entirely
      self-contained.
    * Changed one reference to sprintf() to snprintf() and changed uidstr
      in p_getpwuid() to have a length of BUFSIZ.
    * Added config option (LDAPNegativeCache) to turn LDAP negative caching
      on and off. The default is off (don't do LDAP negative caching).
    * Added entries to doc/Configuration.html for all the LDAP configuration
      directives.
    * MacGyver added mod_ldap to the ProFTPD CVS tree; proftpd-ldap-1.1
      is now in sync with ProFTPD CVS.

v1.0:
    * Initial release of proftpd-ldap
