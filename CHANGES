v2.0:
* config file syntax revamped:
   LDAPServer            localhost
   LDAPDNInfo            cn=your-dn,dc=horde,dc=net dnpass
   LDAPQueryTimeout      5
   LDAPDoAuth            on "dc=horde,dc=net"
   LDAPDoUIDLookups      on "dc=horde,dc=net"
   LDAPDoGIDLookups      on "dc=horde,dc=net"
   LDAPDefaultUID        35000
   LDAPDefaultGID        1000
   LDAPNegativeCache     on
   LDAPHomedirOnDemand   on
   LDAPDefaultAuthScheme clear
* query timeout implemented
* clear password "encryption" scheme implemented
* group lookups
* separate prefixes for user and group lookups
* can turn on/off user/group lookups independently of each other
* default [ug]ids. say you want to have a web-toaster type of deal, with
  all users having the same [ug]ids. just don't put [ug]idNumber attrs 
  in your ldap db for those users, and set either of these two config
  directives. any user that doesn't have a [ug]id in the ldap database  
  will have that info filled in with the default [ug]id.
* allowedServices attr: (i broke with objectclass here, couldn't find
  something that seemed to fit this.) comma-separated list of services to 
  allow for this particular user. say you want to enable ftp access for
  a user, but not www service. set the allowedServices attr for that  
  particular user to "FTP" and www service will be denied. basically, 
  if the string FTP is listed in this attr, ftp access will be allowed.  
* query timeout config file directive added
* you can have alternate ldap servers; just specify LDAPServer "host1
  host2"; thanks to Peter Deacon <peterd@iea-software.com> for pointing this
  out.
* clear authentication scheme. some ldap servers support {clear} for
  no password encryption.

v1.2:
* made the variables for the config entries static
* moved the meat of the ldap querying code to a separate function, this
  gets the individual getpw*() handlers down to about 15-20 lines each.
  also paves the way for easy LDAP group lookups too.
* explicitly set ld = NULL in p_endpwent(), looks like ldap_unbind()
  doesn't always set it to NULL, and bad things happen later.
* fixed a showstopper: if there's a user/group directive in proftpd.conf,
  mod_ldap:getpwnam() will be called to look up the user. since the
  LDAP config variables aren't initialized yet, the LDAP libraries crash
  and burn upon encountering a NULL ldap_prefix. put some checks in
  p_setpwent() to check for this and disable LDAP lookups before the
  parent forks and the config is initialized. thanks to Sean Murphy
  <smurphy@berbee.com> for sending me on this path.
* modified pw_auth() so that it will assume crypt() if there's no leading
  {scheme} in the password returned by the LDAP query.
* pw_auth() turned off logging of unidentifiable password encryption
  schemes; this would syslog the encrypted password returned by the ldap
  server. many people have their logs tightened, but not all.
* a few miscellaneous changes & cleanups

v1.1:
* Added $Libraries$ directive to mod_ldap so the module is now entirely
  self-contained.
* Changed one reference to sprintf() to snprintf() and changed uidstr
  in p_getpwuid() to have a length of BUFSIZ.
* Added config option (LDAPNegativeCache) to turn LDAP negative caching
  on and off. The default is off (don't do LDAP negative caching).
* Added entries to doc/Configuration.html for all the LDAP configuration
  directives.
* MacGyver added mod_ldap to the ProFTPD CVS tree; proftpd-ldap-1.1
  is now in sync with ProFTPD CVS.

v1.0:
* Initial release of proftpd-ldap
