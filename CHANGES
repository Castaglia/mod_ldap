v1.2:
	* made the variables for the config entries static
	* moved the meat of the ldap querying code to a separate function, this
	  gets the individual getpw*() handlers down to about 15-20 lines each.
	  also paves the way for easy LDAP group lookups too.
	* explicitly set ld = NULL in p_endpwent(), looks like ldap_unbind()
	  doesn't always set it to NULL, and bad things happen later.
	* fixed a showstopper: if there's a user/group directive in proftpd.conf,
	  mod_ldap:getpwnam() will be called to look up the user. since the
	  LDAP config variables aren't initialized yet, the LDAP libraries crash
	  and burn upon encountering a NULL ldap_prefix. put some checks in
	  p_setpwent() to check for this and disable LDAP lookups before the
	  parent forks and the config is initialized. thanks to Sean Murphy
	  <smurphy@berbee.com> for sending me on this path.
	* modified pw_auth() so that it will assume crypt() if there's no leading
	  {scheme} in the password returned by the LDAP query.
	* pw_auth() turned off logging of unidentifiable password encryption
	  schemes; this would syslog the encrypted password returned by the ldap
	  server. many people have their logs tightened, but not all.
	* a few miscellaneous changes & cleanups

v1.1:
    * Added $Libraries$ directive to mod_ldap so the module is now entirely
      self-contained.
    * Changed one reference to sprintf() to snprintf() and changed uidstr
      in p_getpwuid() to have a length of BUFSIZ.
    * Added config option (LDAPNegativeCache) to turn LDAP negative caching
      on and off. The default is off (don't do LDAP negative caching).
    * Added entries to doc/Configuration.html for all the LDAP configuration
      directives.
    * MacGyver added mod_ldap to the ProFTPD CVS tree; proftpd-ldap-1.1
      is now in sync with ProFTPD CVS.

v1.0:
    * Initial release of proftpd-ldap
